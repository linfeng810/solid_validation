# solid_validation

A post processing script for IC-FERST FSI. 
The script retieves data in .vtu/.pvtu files according to material coordinate (stored as SolidOriginalCoordinateX/Y/Z).

A new class evtu based on vtu is built. Class vtu is taken from Fluidity [vtktools.py](https://github.com/FluidityProject/fluidity/blob/master/python/vtktools.py).
